# Median Household Income Analysis (U.S. Census Data)

This project explores demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with median household income in the United States using publicly available U.S. Census data.

The analysis focuses on cleaning raw census data, engineering interpretable features, and applying stats and machine learning models to understand which variables are most strongly related to income levels.
